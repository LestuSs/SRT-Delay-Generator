# SRT Delay Generator

Do you have any SRT that is not correctly timed?
You can use SRT Delay Generator to add a positive or negative delay, and it will automatically change it for all of your .srt file !

New versions coming soon
## Installation
### Python
Installation should be quick, the project only uses tkinter to ask the user for a file, and the ```os.path``` module to save the generated file.
    
## Usage/Examples

### Python
To execute it from bash :
```bash
python path/to/the/main.py
```
Now you just have to run the script, the script will ask you for the .srt file you want to add a delay on, and then ask you for the delay.
The new file will be located in the same folder as the original file.
